Databricks is a cloud-based platform that unifies data, analytics, and AI into a single environment. It's built around a **"lakehouse" architecture**, which combines the flexibility and low cost of data lakes with the performance and reliability of data warehouses. This allows data engineers, scientists, and analysts to collaborate more effectively.

---

## Core Components and Concepts

* **The Lakehouse Architecture:** This is the foundational idea of Databricks. It creates a single, reliable source for all data by layering data warehousing capabilities, like **ACID transactions** and schema enforcement, directly on top of cloud data storage (like Amazon S3 or Azure Data Lake Storage). 
* **Apache Spark:** As Databricks was founded by the creators of Spark, the platform provides a highly optimized and managed version of this powerful open-source engine for large-scale data processing and analytics.
* **Delta Lake:** This is an open-source storage layer that brings reliability to your data lake. It adds crucial features like ACID transactions, time travel (data versioning), and scalable metadata management, ensuring data quality and consistency.
* **Unity Catalog:** A unified governance solution that allows you to manage access control, audit trails, and data lineage for all your data and AI assets across different workspaces and cloud environments.
* **MLflow:** An integrated, open-source platform to manage the entire machine learning lifecycle. It helps data scientists track experiments, package code into reproducible models, and deploy them for serving.

---

## Key Product Areas

The Databricks platform is structured to serve different roles within a data team:

* **Data Engineering:** Provides tools for building robust and automated data pipelines. Features like **Delta Live Tables** simplify the development of both batch and streaming ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
* **Databricks SQL:** A serverless data warehouse environment designed for analysts to run high-performance SQL queries. It connects seamlessly with popular Business Intelligence (BI) tools like Tableau and Power BI.
* **Databricks Machine Learning:** An end-to-end collaborative environment for building, training, and deploying ML models at scale. It comes pre-loaded with popular ML libraries and managed MLflow.

# 3.Lakehouse Architecture

A lakehouse architecture is a modern data management system that combines the low-cost, flexible storage of a data lake with the high-performance, structured features of a data warehouse. This unified approach eliminates the need for separate systems, allowing organizations to run business intelligence (BI), analytics, and machine learning (ML) workloads on a single platform.



---

## Core Components

A lakehouse adds data warehousing capabilities on top of inexpensive cloud storage by using open-source table formats.

* **Storage Layer:** This is the foundation, typically using cloud object storage like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage to hold vast amounts of structured and unstructured data in open formats like Apache Parquet.
* **Metadata Layer (Table Format):** This is the key innovation. Open-source formats like **Delta Lake**, **Apache Iceberg**, and **Apache Hudi** create a transactional metadata layer over the raw files, enabling features such as:
    * **ACID Transactions:** Ensures data reliability and consistency during concurrent read/write operations.
    * **Schema Enforcement and Evolution:** Protects data quality by preventing incorrect data types from being written and allows tables to adapt to new data formats over time.
    * **Time Travel:** Provides access to historical versions of a table for auditing, rollbacks, or reproducing experiments.
* **Compute Layer:** The processing power is separate from the storage, allowing you to scale each independently. Engines like **Apache Spark** are used to query and process the data.
* **Catalog Layer:** A central registry for all metadata, making it easy to discover, manage, and govern data assets.

---

## Comparison with Traditional Architectures

The lakehouse was developed to overcome the limitations of having separate data lakes and data warehouses.

* **Users:** Dedicated to a single, automated job rather than interactive use.

---

## Key Cluster Configuration Options

When creating a cluster, you can fine-tune its setup to meet specific needs.

* **Databricks Runtime:** This is the core software that runs on your cluster. You can choose a version based on the required Spark version or select a specialized runtime, like the **ML runtime**, which comes pre-packaged with popular machine learning libraries.
* **Access Mode:** This setting controls security and isolation. **Single User** mode provides a dedicated environment for one person, while **Shared** mode allows multiple users to run commands on the same cluster with appropriate isolation.
* **Worker and Driver Nodes:** You can specify the type and number of virtual machines for your cluster. You can choose from general-purpose, memory-optimized, or GPU-accelerated instances depending on your workload.
* **Autoscaling:** This feature automatically adjusts the number of worker nodes up or down based on the current workload, which helps optimize costs by using only the resources you need.
* **Instance Pools:** To reduce cluster start times, you can create a pool of idle, ready-to-use virtual machine instances.
* **Photon:** You can enable this high-performance, vectorized query engine to dramatically speed up SQL and DataFrame workloads.
* **Cluster Policies:** Administrators can set up rules to limit the available configuration options for users, helping to control costs and enforce organizational standards.

# 7.DataBricks Filestore
Of course\! Here is the information about the Databricks FileStore converted into Markdown.

Databricks FileStore is a special directory within the Databricks File System (DBFS) that allows you to store files, such as images and CSVs, and access them through a public web URL. It's a convenient but legacy feature primarily used for sharing small files or embedding content in notebooks. For production data, Databricks now recommends using the more secure **Unity Catalog volumes**.

-----

## Common Uses for FileStore

  * **Uploading Data:** You can easily upload small data files like CSVs or images directly through the Databricks UI into the `/FileStore` directory.
  * **Sharing Files:** It enables the creation of direct, browser-accessible links to download files or plots you've saved.
  * **Hosting Images:** You can store images in `/FileStore` and embed them directly into your notebooks to enhance documentation or visualizations.
  * **Storing Libraries and Scripts:** It can be a place to store shared libraries (like JARs or Python wheels) and scripts that need to be accessed by multiple clusters.

-----

## How to Access FileStore

You can interact with the FileStore in several ways.

#### Using the Databricks UI

  * **To Upload:** Navigate to the **"Data"** or **"DBFS"** tab in your workspace and use the "Upload File" feature.
  * **To Download:**
    1.  Find the DBFS path of your file (e.g., `dbfs:/FileStore/my-file.csv`).
    2.  Construct a URL by replacing `dbfs:/FileStore/` with `/files/` and prepending your workspace URL.
    3.  **Example URL:** `https://<your-databricks-workspace-url>/files/my-file.csv`

#### Using Databricks Utilities (`dbutils`) in a Notebook

You can manage files programmatically within a notebook.

  * **To list contents:**
    ```python
    dbutils.fs.ls("/FileStore")
    ```
  * **To copy a file:**
    ```python
    # Copy a file from the local driver node to FileStore
    dbutils.fs.cp("file:/tmp/temp_file.csv", "dbfs:/FileStore/my_data.csv")
    ```

#### Using the Databricks CLI

The command-line interface allows you to manage files from your local machine.

  * **To copy a file from local to FileStore:**
    ```bash
    databricks fs cp /path/to/local/file.csv dbfs:/FileStore/my_data.csv
    ```
  * **To copy a file from FileStore to local:**
    ```bash
    databricks fs cp dbfs:/FileStore/my_data.csv /path/to/local/my_data.csv
    ```

-----

## Important Security Considerations

While convenient, FileStore has security limitations that make it unsuitable for sensitive data.

  * Files in the DBFS root, including FileStore, are accessible to **all users** in the workspace by default.
  * It is not recommended for storing sensitive or production data. The current best practice is to use **Unity Catalog volumes** for securely managing and governing access to non-tabular data. üìÇ


# 8.Hive metastore in databricks

Of course\! Here is the information about the Hive metastore in Databricks converted into Markdown.

In Databricks, the Hive metastore is the traditional, legacy catalog used for organizing data tables. While it's still functional, it has been superseded by **Unity Catalog**, which is now the recommended solution for modern data governance. Every Databricks workspace contains this legacy Hive metastore.

-----

## Working with the Hive Metastore

You can interact with the Hive metastore in two primary ways:

  * **Built-in Hive Metastore:** Each workspace has its own default Hive metastore. Data objects managed by it are accessible in Unity Catalog-enabled workspaces through a special catalog named **`hive_metastore`**.
  * **External Hive Metastore:** You can connect your Databricks workspace to an external Hive metastore, such as a self-managed database or the AWS Glue Data Catalog. This is often done during migrations or to maintain compatibility with other systems.

-----

## Transitioning to Unity Catalog

Databricks strongly recommends upgrading from the Hive metastore to Unity Catalog to take advantage of its superior governance and security features.

| Feature | Hive Metastore | Unity Catalog |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Governance** | Basic governance using legacy **Table Access Control (ACLs)**. | Centralized, modern governance with fine-grained security. |
| **Object Hierarchy** | Two-level namespace: `schema.table`. | Three-level namespace: `catalog.schema.table`. |
| **Workspace Scope**| Scoped to a single workspace; sharing is difficult. | Centralized at the account level; easily shared across workspaces. |
| **Table Management** | Dropped managed tables are permanently deleted. | Dropped managed tables can be recovered using `UNDROP`. |
| **Auditing/Lineage**| No built-in lineage or auditing features. | Natively tracks data lineage for compliance and discovery. |

-----

## Hive Metastore Federation

**Hive metastore federation** is a Unity Catalog feature that allows you to govern tables registered in a Hive metastore without immediately migrating them. When you query a federated table, Unity Catalog manages the access controls and auditing, while the underlying Hive metastore provides the metadata. This enables a gradual and smoother transition to Unity Catalog.

-----

## Accessing the Legacy Hive Metastore

Even in a Unity Catalog-enabled workspace, you can still access objects in the legacy metastore by using the `hive_metastore` catalog name in your queries.

For example, to query `my_table` in `my_schema`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM hive_metastore.my_schema.my_table;
```

While this access is available, the best practice is to fully migrate your tables to Unity Catalog for better overall performance, security, and governance. üóÇÔ∏è



# 9.FileTypes in databricks

Databricks supports a wide variety of file types, but the most important format for building a modern data platform is **Delta Lake**. It's the default and recommended choice because it combines the performance of columnar formats like Parquet with the reliability of ACID transactions.

---

## Standard and Columnar Formats

These are the foundational formats for data storage and processing, supported by the Apache Spark engine.

* **Delta Lake:** The default format in Databricks. It's built on Parquet and adds a transaction log that enables **ACID transactions**, time travel (data versioning), and schema enforcement, making it the ideal choice for a reliable lakehouse.
* **Parquet:** A high-performance, open-source columnar format that provides excellent compression and is optimized for analytics. The underlying data in a Delta table is stored in Parquet files.
* **ORC (Optimized Row Columnar):** Another efficient columnar format, commonly used in the Hadoop ecosystem.
* **CSV (Comma-Separated Values):** A simple, human-readable text format. It's easy to use for small datasets but is much less performant than columnar formats for large-scale analytics.
* **JSON:** A text-based format that is great for semi-structured data due to its support for nested structures.
* **Avro:** A row-based binary format that excels in streaming data scenarios because of its strong support for schema evolution.
* **Text & Binary:** Basic formats for handling raw text files (one record per line) or binary data like images.
* **XML:** A text-based format for structured data that may require extra configuration to parse correctly.

---

## Workspace Files

These files are used for development artifacts within the Databricks workspace and are not intended for storing large datasets.

* **Notebooks:** Can be saved in various formats, including `.py`, `.sql`, `.r`, `.scala`, and `.ipynb` (Jupyter).
* **Source Code & Config:** Standard files for code (`.py`, `.sql`), documentation (`README.md`), and configuration (`.yaml`).
* **Libraries:** Custom dependencies packaged as Python wheels (`.whl`) or Java archives (`.jar`).
* **Queries & Dashboards:** Files related to Databricks SQL objects, such as `.dbalert.json` and `.lvdash.json`.

---

## Other Table Formats

Databricks also supports other open table formats that provide similar transactional capabilities to Delta Lake.

* **Iceberg:** An open-source table format that brings ACID transactions and robust schema evolution to large analytic datasets.
* **Hudi:** Another open-source format designed to simplify incremental data processing and data pipeline development.

---

## Choosing a File Format

The best format depends on your specific needs:

* **Delta Lake:** The go-to choice for almost all use cases in Databricks. Use it for building reliable data pipelines, data warehousing, and ML workloads.
* **Parquet and ORC:** Excellent for high-performance analytics, though Delta Lake is generally preferred as it builds upon Parquet's strengths.
* **CSV and JSON:** Best for initial data ingestion, ad-hoc analysis of small files, or when working with human-readable data.
* **Avro:** Ideal for streaming data pipelines where the schema might change over time.
* **Workspace Files:** Use these exclusively for your code, notebooks, and project configurations. Store all large datasets in cloud storage, preferably as Delta tables. üíæ


# 10.Databricks security fundamentals

Databricks security is built on a multi-layered, "defense-in-depth" strategy to protect your data, users, and workspaces. The cornerstone of this framework is the **Unity Catalog**, which provides a centralized governance layer for all your data and AI assets across multiple clouds and workspaces.

---

## Databricks Security Architecture

Databricks operates on a **shared responsibility model**, which defines the security obligations of Databricks and you, the customer.

* **Databricks' Responsibility (Control Plane):** Databricks secures the underlying infrastructure that hosts its web application, notebooks, job scheduler, and cluster management services.
* **Your Responsibility (Data Plane):** You are responsible for securing your data, which is processed on compute resources (clusters) running in your own cloud account and stored in your own cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage).



Key security areas include:
* Unified governance with **Unity Catalog**.
* Authentication and access control.
* Network security and isolation.
* Data encryption.
* Secrets management.
* Auditing and compliance.

---

## Unity Catalog for Centralized Governance

Unity Catalog is the central pillar of Databricks security, providing a single place to administer data access policies across all your workspaces.

* **Unified Metadata:** It acts as a central catalog for all your data and AI assets, including tables, ML models, and notebooks.
* **Fine-Grained Access Control:** Use standard SQL commands to grant or revoke permissions at the catalog, schema, table, or even row/column level.
* **Data Masking:** Secure sensitive data by creating dynamic views with row filters and column masks that apply different rules based on user privileges.
* **Data Lineage:** Automatically captures how data is created and used across different languages and notebooks, which is crucial for impact analysis and compliance.
* **Audit Logs:** Automatically logs all access to data assets, providing a comprehensive trail for security monitoring and auditing.
* **Workspace Isolation:** You can bind specific catalogs to certain workspaces, ensuring that production data is completely isolated from development environments.

---

## Authentication and Access Control

Databricks provides robust features to manage who can access your environment and what they can do.

* **Identity Providers:** Integrate with your existing identity provider (like Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, or AWS IAM) for centralized identity management.
* **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Enforce SSO to simplify user login and improve security.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assign permissions to users and groups based on their roles to implement the principle of least privilege.
* **Personal Access Tokens (PATs):** Securely manage and monitor API access.
* **Cluster Policies:** Restrict how users can configure compute clusters to control costs and enforce standards.

---

## Networking and Data Encryption

Databricks ensures your data is protected from unauthorized access, whether it's at rest or in transit.

* **Private Connectivity:** Use services like AWS PrivateLink or Azure Private Link to create a secure, private connection between your network and the Databricks control plane.
* **Encryption at Rest:** Your data is encrypted by default using keys managed by your cloud provider. For enhanced control, you can use **customer-managed keys** for both workspace storage and managed services.
* **Encryption in Transit:** All traffic between cluster worker nodes is encrypted to protect data as it's being processed.
* **Serverless Egress Control:** Define strict outbound network rules for serverless workloads to prevent data exfiltration.

---

## Monitoring and Compliance

Databricks provides tools to monitor your environment and meet regulatory requirements.

* **Enhanced Security Monitoring (ESM):** An add-on that provides a hardened operating system, antivirus, and file integrity monitoring for your compute resources.
* **Compliance Security Profile (CSP):** A pre-validated security configuration that includes ESM and FIPS 140-validated encryption to help meet standards like HIPAA and PCI-DSS.
* **Audit Logs:** Access detailed, user-level audit logs through system tables to monitor activity and investigate security events.

---

## Security Best Practices

* **Adopt Unity Catalog:** Make it the foundation of your governance strategy.
* **Use Group-Based Access:** Grant permissions to groups instead of individual users to simplify management.
* **Isolate Environments:** Use workspace-catalog bindings to keep production and development data separate.
* **Enforce Encryption:** Use customer-managed keys for sensitive data.
* **Implement Network Controls:** Use private connectivity and limit public network access.
* **Monitor Activity:** Regularly review audit logs and enable enhanced security monitoring to detect threats. üîí


# 11.Delta lake

Delta Lake is the default storage layer in Databricks that forms the foundation of the **lakehouse architecture**. It adds a layer of reliability and performance on top of standard cloud storage (like AWS S3 or Azure Data Lake Storage) by combining the best features of a data warehouse with the flexibility of a data lake.

---

## Core Components

Delta Lake's power comes from two main components:

* **Data Files:** The actual data is stored in the highly efficient, open-source **Apache Parquet** format. A Delta table is simply a directory of these columnar files.
* **Transaction Log (`_delta_log`):** This is the "brain" of Delta Lake. It's a directory containing an ordered record of every transaction ever made to the table. This log is what enables Delta Lake's most powerful features:
    * **ACID Transactions:** Ensures that operations complete fully or not at all, which prevents data corruption from failed jobs or concurrent writes.
    * **Time Travel (Data Versioning):** Since every change is logged, you can query a table as it existed at a specific time or version number. This is invaluable for audits, rollbacks, and reproducing machine learning experiments.
    * **Scalable Metadata:** The log allows Delta Lake to handle petabyte-scale tables with billions of files without the performance bottlenecks of traditional data lakes.



---

## Key Features on Databrbricks

Databricks optimizes and extends Delta Lake with several key features:

* **Unified Batch and Streaming:** You can use a single Delta table as both a batch table and a real-time streaming source and sink, dramatically simplifying your data architecture.
* **Schema Enforcement and Evolution:** Delta Lake protects data quality by rejecting writes that don't match a table's schema (**schema enforcement**). It also allows you to safely add new columns to a table as your data needs change (**schema evolution**).
* **Full DML Support:** Unlike raw Parquet files, Delta tables fully support standard SQL commands like `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `MERGE` (upsert), which is essential for handling change data capture (CDC) and other common data warehousing tasks.
* **Performance Optimizations:** Databricks includes several features to speed up queries on Delta tables:
    * **Data Skipping:** Automatically reads only the relevant files for a query based on statistics stored in the transaction log.
    * **Z-Ordering:** A technique for co-locating related data in the same files to drastically improve query performance when filtering on multiple columns.
    * **File Management:** The `OPTIMIZE` command compacts small files into larger ones for better read performance, while `VACUUM` removes old, unreferenced data files to save on storage costs.
* **Medallion Architecture:** This is a best-practice pattern for structuring data pipelines with Delta Lake, organized into three layers:
    * **Bronze:** Raw, ingested data from source systems.
    * **Silver:** Filtered, cleaned, and enriched data.
    * **Gold:** Aggregated, business-level tables ready for analytics and reporting.

## How It Works Within Databricks

Delta Lake is deeply integrated into the Databricks platform. When you create a table using SQL or Spark DataFrames, it is a Delta table by default. This seamless integration means you get all the benefits of reliability and performance automatically. Databricks also provides several related technologies that build on Delta Lake:

* **Delta Live Tables:** A declarative framework for easily building and managing reliable ETL pipelines.
* **Delta Sharing:** An open protocol for securely sharing live data from your lakehouse with other organizations.
* **Delta Engine:** The high-performance query engine in Databricks, which is optimized to accelerate queries on Delta Lake. üåä


# 12.ACID transactions

Databricks provides **ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) transactions** through its default storage layer, **Delta Lake**. This brings the reliability of a traditional data warehouse to your data lake, ensuring high data integrity and preventing corruption, even when multiple users and jobs are running at the same time.

---

## How Delta Lake Provides ACID Guarantees

Delta Lake achieves ACID compliance by pairing Parquet data files with a detailed **transaction log** (known as the `_delta_log`). This log is the single source of truth that records every change made to a table.



#### Atomicity
* **How it works:** Every operation (like a write or update) is treated as a single, "all-or-nothing" unit. If any part of the operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the table is left untouched. This prevents data from ever being left in a partially complete or corrupt state.
* **Example:** If a streaming job writing 1,000 new records fails after writing only 500, none of those records will be committed to the final table.

#### Consistency
* **How it works:** Delta Lake uses **optimistic concurrency control**. When a transaction is ready to commit, it first checks if another job has modified the data since it was read. If a conflict is found, the transaction will fail, ensuring the table is always in a valid state.
* **Example:** If two jobs try to update the same file at the same time, Delta Lake will allow the first one to succeed and will fail the second with an error, preventing a data conflict.

#### Isolation
* **How it works:** Concurrent operations do not interfere with each other. Delta Lake provides this guarantee through different isolation levels:
    * **Writes (`WriteSerializable`):** This ensures that all write operations appear to happen in a single, serial order, even if they run concurrently.
    * **Reads (`SnapshotIsolation`):** When you query a table, you see a consistent snapshot of the data from the moment the query began. You won't see partial results from other jobs that are still running.

#### Durability
* **How it works:** Once a transaction is successfully committed to the transaction log, it is permanent. Since the log and data files are stored in durable cloud object storage (like AWS S3 or Azure Data Lake Storage), your changes will survive system failures.
* **Example:** If the compute cluster shuts down unexpectedly right after a write operation completes, the committed data is safe in cloud storage and will be available when the system comes back online.

---

## Key Transactional Features on Databricks

* **Single-Table Transactions:** Transactions in Databricks are atomic only for a single Delta table. The platform does not support atomic transactions that span multiple tables.
* **`MERGE INTO` Command:** This powerful command allows you to perform complex inserts, updates, and deletes on a table as a single, atomic operation. It's extremely useful for change data capture (CDC) workloads.
* **No Locks:** Because Delta Lake uses optimistic concurrency, readers and writers don't block each other. This allows for very high levels of concurrency without the risk of deadlocks.
* **Multi-Cluster Writes:** Delta Lake is designed to handle simultaneous writes from multiple clusters to the same table without corrupting the data. üõ°Ô∏è


# 12.Schema evaluation in databricks


Schema evolution in Databricks is a feature of **Delta Lake** that allows the structure of a table to change over time, such as adding new columns, without breaking existing data pipelines. It works by combining strict **schema enforcement** by default to prevent data corruption with an optional, flexible **schema evolution** to handle intentional changes.

-----

## Key Concepts: Enforcement vs. Evolution

  * **Schema Enforcement (Default):** To protect data integrity, Delta Lake automatically rejects any data being written that does not exactly match the table's current schema (e.g., wrong data types, extra columns). This prevents bad data from corrupting your tables.
  * **Schema Evolution (Optional):** This is the mechanism you explicitly enable to allow the table's schema to be updated automatically during a write operation. It's the solution for intentionally adding new columns or making other supported changes.

-----

## Methods for Schema Evolution

#### 1\. Automatic Evolution for Appends and Overwrites

This is the most common method, used when you need to add new columns to a table.

  * **Purpose:** To automatically add new columns found in the source data to the target Delta table.
  * **How to Enable:** Use the `.option("mergeSchema", "true")` setting in your write command.
  * **Behavior:**
      * New columns in the source DataFrame are added to the table's schema.
      * Existing records will have a `NULL` value for the newly added columns.
  * **Syntax:**
    ```python
    df.write.format("delta") \
      .option("mergeSchema", "true") \
      .mode("append") \
      .save("/path/to/delta/table")
    ```

#### 2\. Automatic Evolution for `MERGE` Operations

You can evolve the schema directly within a `MERGE` statement for upsert operations.

  * **Purpose:** To automatically add new columns from a source table during an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` operation within a `MERGE`.
  * **How to Enable:** Add the `WITH SCHEMA EVOLUTION` clause at the end of the `MERGE` statement.
  * **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    MERGE INTO target_table
    USING source_table ON target_table.id = source_table.id
    WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET *
    WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *
    WITH SCHEMA EVOLUTION;
    ```

#### 3\. Manual Schema Changes with `ALTER TABLE`

For more direct control, you can use standard SQL DDL commands.

  * **Adding Columns:**
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE my_table ADD COLUMN new_col STRING;
    ```
  * **Changing Data Types or Renaming Columns:** This requires rewriting the entire table with the `.option("overwriteSchema", "true")`.
    ```python
    df.write.format("delta") \
      .mode("overwrite") \
      .option("overwriteSchema", "true") \
      .saveAsTable("my_table")
    ```
  * **Dropping Columns:**
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE my_table DROP COLUMN old_col;
    ```

-----

## Schema Evolution in Structured Streaming (Auto Loader)

For streaming data pipelines, **Auto Loader** provides powerful, automated schema management.

  * **Automatic Inference:** Auto Loader can detect the schema of incoming files and automatically evolve the target table's schema when it detects new columns.
  * **Handling Bad Data:** It can be configured to capture malformed or mismatched data in a `_rescued_data` column instead of failing the stream, making your pipelines more robust.

-----

## Supported and Unsupported Changes

| Action | Automatic Evolution (`mergeSchema`) | Manual Intervention (`overwriteSchema`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Adding a New Column** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Widening a Data Type** | ‚úÖ Yes (e.g., `Int` to `Long`) | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Changing `NullType`** | ‚úÖ Yes (merges to the new type) | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Renaming a Column** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes (with column mapping enabled) |
| **Dropping a Column** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes (with column mapping enabled) |
| **Narrowing a Data Type** | ‚ùå No (causes an error) | ‚úÖ Yes |


# 13.Time Travel in databricks

Time travel in Databricks is a feature of Delta Lake that allows you to access and query historical versions of your data. Because every change to a Delta table is automatically versioned in a transaction log, you can easily "travel back in time" to a previous state using either a version number or a timestamp.

-----

## How It Works

Time travel is powered by the **transaction log** (`_delta_log`) in every Delta Lake table. Here's the process:

1.  Every time you perform an operation (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `MERGE`), Delta Lake creates a new version of the table.
2.  Instead of modifying the original data files, it writes new files and records the transaction in the log.
3.  The old data files are kept for a specific retention period, making previous versions of the table accessible.

-----

## Primary Uses

This feature is incredibly useful for several reasons:

  * **Audit data changes:** Investigate exactly how and when data was modified for compliance or debugging.
  * **Roll back mistakes:** Quickly restore a table to a correct state after an accidental deletion or a bad data write.
  * **Reproduce experiments:** Allow data scientists to access the exact version of the data that was used to train a model or generate a report.
  * **Run temporal queries:** Compare data between two different points in time, such as this month's sales versus last month's.

-----

## How to Use Time Travel

You can access historical data using either a version number or a timestamp. To find a table's version history, you can run the `DESCRIBE HISTORY my_delta_table;` command.

#### Using a Version Number

Specify the exact version you want to query using the **`VERSION AS OF`** clause.

  * **SQL:**
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM my_delta_table VERSION AS OF 10;
    ```
  * **Python:**
    ```python
    df = spark.read.option("versionAsOf", 10).table("my_delta_table")
    ```

#### Using a Timestamp

Query the state of a table at a specific point in time using the **`TIMESTAMP AS OF`** clause.

  * **SQL:**
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM my_delta_table TIMESTAMP AS OF "2025-08-25 18:30:00";
    ```
  * **Python:**
    ```python
    df = spark.read.option("timestampAsOf", "2025-08-25 18:30:00").table("my_delta_table")
    ```

#### Restoring a Table

To revert a table to a previous state, use the **`RESTORE`** command. This creates a new commit that restores the older version, so you don't lose the subsequent history.

  * **SQL:**
    ```sql
    RESTORE TABLE my_delta_table TO VERSION AS OF 10;
    ```

-----

## Important Considerations

  * **Data Retention:** The history is not kept forever. Its duration is controlled by table properties, with a default of 30 days for the transaction log and 7 days for the underlying data files.
  * **`VACUUM` Command:** Running the **`VACUUM`** command permanently deletes old data files that are past the retention period. Once these files are gone, you can no longer time travel to the versions that depended on them. Be careful when running this command. üï∞Ô∏è
